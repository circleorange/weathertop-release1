## To Do ##
(y) Create field Wind direction in Reading
(y) Create fields Wind Chill and Wind Compass in Station
(y) Create conversion methods for the fields
    (-) Improvement: Refactor conversion methods to return two values for e.g. beaufortScale and beaufortLabel
(y) Display the new fields on the Dashboard
    (-) Improvement: Reformat wind chill. Currently, If 6.80 -> Displays 6.8
(y) Change Dashboard to shows station list (Playlist9b)
(y) Add button to open each station (Playlist10b)
    (y) Add routes for accessing station
    (y) Add delete button to remove readings
    (y) Add button to create new readings
(y) Add button to create new Station
    (-) Handle errors with new stations having null values upon creation
(-) Create Github repository

To handle possible null values through the play framework is to add a question mark in the view after the object, variable or method call.
So in your case it would be ${newestReading?.code} or ${newestReading?.code?}
As Ignas mentioned, after a new station is created, there are no readings yet so the variable is null.
Not sure if this will get you sorted but it might be worth a try.
